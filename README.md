# Monero-Tools

A swift-based iOS collection of Monero-related tools (Currently 1 tool(s))
In the future, I'd love to incorporate more Monero-realted functions into the app. 

This app is designed to be a simplification and convieniece for XMR.to on iOS devices. 
Quickly create a Monero address to anonymously pay any Bitcoin address, and track your request history and payment statuses. 
This app does not handle the actual sending of coins. 

For payment support, please contact support@xmr.to
For application support, please utilize this GitHub. 

I'd love advice/criticism/suggestions, and especially new ideas. 

Love the app? Feel free to donate and support developer fees!
